# GettingStarted

Contained herein is a collection of material (source code, scripts, examples, etc...) to be used for setting up user environments, running jobs, debugging and tuning applications, and related tasks for successful use of computational resources at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF).

Material here is typically developed for and used during ALCF training workshops, such as the ALCF Computational Performance Workshops typically held in the Spring and the ALCF Simulation, Data, and Learning Workshops in the Fall.

If not sure where to start, then a good place may be perusing ProgrammingModels for the resource of interest to gain experience compiling codes and submitting jobs.

## Contents

<ol>
<li> Applications: Example Makefiles, build scripts, etc... for some applications

<li> Examples: Collection of examples demonstrating common tasks (e.g. compilation & setting affinity)
<li> Performance: Simple examples using availble performance tools
<li> ProgrammingModels: Simple examples using supported programming models

# ThetaGPU

ThetaGPU is an extension of Theta and is comprised of 24 NVIDIA DGX A100 nodes, each with eight NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and two AMD Rome CPUs. Additional hardware information is available [here][1].
