# GettingStarted

Contained herein is a collection of material (source code, scripts, examples, etc...) to be used for setting up user environments, running jobs, debugging and tuning applications, and related tasks for successful use of computational resources at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF).

Material here is typically used for ALCF training workshops, such as the ALCF Computational Performance Workshops typically held in the Spring and the ALCF Simulation, Data, and Learning Workshops in the Fall.

The ALCF Performance Engineering group has additional helpful material available here: https://github.com/alcf-perfengr.
